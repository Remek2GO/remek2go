## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a passionate Python developer actively honing my skills through various science club projects. My experience includes working on vision systems, algorithm development, and API creation. I am also expanding my knowledge in control systems, industrial automation, and databases as part of my academic pursuits. I pride myself on being organized, conscientious, and always ready to tackle new challenges.
